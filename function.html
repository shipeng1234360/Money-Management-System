<p>Money is often defined in terms of the five functions or services that it provides. Money serves as a medium of exchange, as a store of value, and as a unit of account.

<h3><a id="function1">Medium of exchange</a></h3> 
<p>Money's most important function is as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by barter, which involves direct exchange of one good or service for another. The difficulty with a barter system is that in order to obtain a particular good or service from a supplier, one has to possess a good or service of equal value, which the supplier also desires. In other words, in a barter system, exchange can take place only if there is a double coincidence of wants between two transacting parties. The likelihood of a double coincidence of wants, however, is small and makes the exchange of goods and services rather difficult. Money effectively eliminates the double coincidence of wants problem by serving as a medium of exchange that is accepted in all transactions, by all parties, regardless of whether they desire each others' goods and services.

<h3><a id="function2">A Measure of Value</a></h3>
<img src="equilibrium2.jpg" alt="2 things which have the same value are equilibrium to each other" width="360" height="240">
<p>Under the barter system, it is very difficult to measure the value of goods. For example, a horse may be valued as worth five cows or 100 quintals of wheat, or a Maruti car may be equivalent to 10 two- wheelers. Thus one of the disadvantages of the barter system is that any commodity or service has a series of exchange values.
</p>

<p>Money is the measuring rod of everything. By acting as a common denominator it permits everything to be priced, that is, valued in terms of money. Thus, people are enabled to com­pare different prices and thus see the relative values of different goods and services.

<ul>
<p>This serves two basic purposes:</p>

<li> Households (consumers) can plan their expenditure</li>

<li> Business people can keep records of in­come and costs in order to work out their profit and loss figures.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<a href="#function1">Medium of exchange</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#function2">A Measure of Value</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#function3">Store of value</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#function4">Basis of Credit</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#function5">Unit of account</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3><a id="function3">Store of value(Purchasing Power)</a></h3>
<p> A major disadvantage of using commodities — such as wheat or salt or even animals like horses or cows — as money is that after a time they deteriorate and lose economic value. They are, thus, not at all satisfactory as a means of storing wealth. To realise the problems of saving in a barter economy let us consider a farmer. He wanted to save some wheat each week for future consumption. But this would be of no use to him in his old age because the ‘savings’ would have gone off.
</p>

<p>Again, if a coal miner wanted to set aside a certain amount of coal each week for the same purpose, he would have problems of finding enough storage space for all his coal. By using money, such problems can be overcome and people are able to save for the future. Modern form of money (such as coins, notes and bank deposits) permit people to save their surplus income.
</p>

<p>Thus money is used as a store of purchasing power. It can be held over a period of time and used to finance future payments. More­over, when people save money, they get the assurance that the money saved will have value when they wish to spend it in the future. However, this statement holds only if there is no severe inflation (or deflation) in the country.
</p>

<p>In other words, it is quite obvious that money can only act effectively as a store of value if its own value is stable. If, for example, most people feel that their savings would become worthless very soon, they would spend them at once and save nothing. For the last few years the value (or the purchasing power) of money has been falling in India. Yet in the short run—for day-to-day purposes—money has sufficient stability of value to serve quite well as a store of value.

<h3><a id="function4">Basis of Credit</a></h3>
<img src="doggy-bank2.jpg" alt="No money no talk" width="360" height="240">
<p>Money facilitates loans. Borrowers can use money to obtain goods and services when they are needed most. A newly married couple, for example, would need a lot of money to completely furnish a house at once. They are not required to wait for, say ten years, so as to be able to save enough money to buy costly items like cars, refrigerators, T.V. sets, etc.

<h3><a id="function5">Unit of account</a></h3>
<p> Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a common measure of the value of goods and services being exchanged. Knowing the value or price of a good, in terms of money, enables both the supplier and the purchaser of the good to make decisions about how much of the good to supply and how much of the good to purchase.
